# Custodian

Custodian is a secure and anonymous communication platform for sources (whistleblowers) to share information with journalists. Inspired by The Guardian's SecureDrop service, Custodian uses ZKSync Era and blockchain technology to provide a user-friendly solution for whistleblowers to share important information with journalists in a secure and confidential manner.

Custodian is dedicated to making the world a better place by enabling whistleblowers to share important information with journalists in a secure and anonymous manner.

# Features

-   Easy-to-use: Our frontend pages are built with Next.js, and all web3 integrations are supported by Ethers.js and RainbowKit. All the steps are user-friendly.

-   Secure & Transparency: All communication and documents are encrypted and stored on-chain, providing a permanent and unalterable record. Whistleblowers can verify the authenticity of leaked information through cryptography technology. This ensures the elimination of the risk of false reports and other unwanted outcomes.

-   Anonymous: Sources can communicate with journalists anonymously, and the encrypted documents are stored on-chain for a specified duration and number of accesses.

-   SBT (SoulBound Token): Journalists must mint our unique SBT in order to be listed on our journalists list and receive messages/documents from sources. SBT provides information about the journalist, including name, email, public wallet address, organization, and professional field.

-   Document storage: Our service utilizes the LightHouse SDK to store documents, allowing for the establishment of a 1-of-2 multi-sig between the source and the target journalist's public address.

# How it Works

Sources (whistleblowers) can communicate with journalists through two simple steps:

1. Choose a journalist from our journalists list.
2. Upload documents/files/messages and set the encryption algorithm, duration, and access count. The encrypted document/message will then be sent to the target journalist.

# Tech Stack
